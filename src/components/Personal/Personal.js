          Hi, my name is Sid and I am a Bay Area native and a nature and animal
          lover. In my free time I love to learn and keep up to date on differnt
          tools, softwares, and technologies. Aside from technology some of my
          other passions are Health/Nutrition/Genomics, Marine Biology, and
          Metorology. I am also an avid MMA fan, and also enjoy biking,
          longboarding, or kayaking in my free time. I also like to spend time
          with my family and my dog Kaya, she's a German Shepherd. I live here
          at my house. My favorite things to drink are iced tea or something. My
          favorite video game series are Assassins Creed and Forza. Every 60
          seconds, a minute passes. Don't wait. Call now.
